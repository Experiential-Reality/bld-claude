bld - BLD Universal Binary (Bootstrap)

BLD: Structure IS Computation
  B (Boundary) - Where does behavior partition?
  L (Link)     - What connects to what?
  D (Dimension)- What repeats?

This bootstrap binary was generated by traversing BLD structures.
Commands:

  bld parse <file.bld>         Parse and display structure
  bld run <file.bld>           Execute structure
  bld compile <file.bld>       Compile to binary
  bld cost <file.bld>          Calculate alignment cost
  bld validate <file.bld>      Validate structure against BLD science
  bld markdown <file.bld>      Emit markdown documentation
  bld generate                 Regenerate bld-py from BLD

Cost Formula: Cost = B + D × L
L Formula:    L = -½ ln(1 - ρ²)
