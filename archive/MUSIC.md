# BLD for Music

> **Status**: Exploratory

Music is structured time. The listener is a traverser. Musical "feel" — tension, resolution, groove, beauty — emerges from structural alignment between the music and the listener's expectations.

## Core Insight

**Music that "works" has aligned structure.**

When harmonic relationships (L) align with rhythmic boundaries (B) and repetition patterns (D), music feels right. Misalignment creates tension — which can be used deliberately or experienced as wrongness.

## The Three Questions Applied to Music

### Q1: Where Does Behavior Partition? → Boundaries (B)

**Ask**: "Where does the musical meaning change?"

| Boundary Type | Discriminator | Regions |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Key** | Tonic note | Major/minor, different keys |
| **Section** | Form | Verse, chorus, bridge, coda |
| **Phrase** | Cadence | Complete vs incomplete ideas |
| **Chord** | Root/quality | Tonic, dominant, subdominant |
| **Beat** | Strong/weak | Downbeat vs upbeat |
| **Mode** | Scale pattern | Ionian, Dorian, Mixolydian... |

**B is TOPOLOGICAL**: The key of C major is the same whether the piece is 2 minutes or 20 minutes. Section boundaries are structural, not durational.

### Q2: What Connects? → Links (L)

**Ask**: "What relates to what? What pulls toward what?"

| Link Type | Source | Target | Musical Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Voice leading** | Chord n | Chord n+1 | Smooth vs jagged |
| **Tension/resolution** | V (dominant) | I (tonic) | Pull, release |
| **Interval** | Note A | Note B | Consonance/dissonance |
| **Motivic** | Theme statement | Development | Recognition, variation |
| **Bass-melody** | Root | Top voice | Foundation, direction |

**L is GEOMETRIC**: Harmonic relationships scale with complexity. More voices = more L. Denser harmony = stronger L.

**The L Formula in Music**:

Consonance follows roughly:
```
L_consonance ~ -½ ln(1 - (a/b)²)
```
Where a:b is the frequency ratio. Small whole-number ratios (2:1 octave, 3:2 fifth) have low L cost — they're consonant.

### Q3: What Repeats? → Dimensions (D)

**Ask**: "What has multiple homogeneous instances?"

| Dimension | Extent | Musical Example |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Beats** | 4 per measure | Pulse grid |
| **Measures** | 4, 8, 16 bar phrases | Phrase structure |
| **Sections** | Verse 1, 2, 3... | Form repetition |
| **Voices** | 4 in SATB | Polyphonic layers |
| **Octaves** | 7-8 on piano | Register space |

**D multiplies L**: More voices (D) = more voice-leading relationships (L). More repetitions of a section don't change its key (B).

---

## D×L Scaling in Music

### Harmony Complexity

```
Simple:   D = 1 voice,  L = melody only
Moderate: D = 4 voices, L = triadic harmony (3 chord tones)
Complex:  D = 4 voices, L = extended harmony (7th, 9th, 11th)

Complexity = D × L_per_voice
```

### Rhythmic Density

```
Sparse: D = few notes per bar
Dense:  D = many notes per bar
        L = relationships between notes

Rhythmic interest = how D×L creates pattern
```

### B Invariance Check

The key (B) is unchanged regardless of:
- How many bars (D)
- How many voices (D)
- How dense the harmony (D×L)

A piece in C major is in C major whether it's a 12-bar blues or a symphony.

---

## The Listener as Traverser

The listener has their own B/L/D structure:

### Listener Boundaries (B)
- Genre expectations (what "counts" as jazz, classical, pop)
- Cultural familiarity (Western vs non-Western scales)
- Attention span (phrase length expectations)

### Listener Links (L)
- Memory of previous phrases
- Prediction of what comes next
- Recognition of patterns

### Listener Dimensions (D)
- Working memory capacity (~4 items)
- Time span of attention
- Musical training depth

**Alignment = Music B/L/D matches Listener B/L/D**

When aligned:
- Expectations met → satisfaction
- Predictions confirmed → groove
- Patterns recognized → meaning

When misaligned:
- Surprise → interest or confusion
- Broken predictions → tension
- Unrecognized patterns → alienation

---

## Tension and Resolution as Alignment

**Tension** = deliberate misalignment (high cost, unstable)
**Resolution** = alignment (low cost, stable)

### Harmonic Tension

| Progression | Tension Level | Why |
|-------------|--------------|-----|
| V → I | Resolution | Strong L pull satisfied |
| ii → V | Building | Partial alignment |
| V/V → V | Delayed | Secondary L chain |
| V → vi | Deceptive | Expected B violated |

### Rhythmic Tension

| Pattern | Tension | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| On the beat | Low | B alignment |
| Syncopation | Medium | L crosses B |
| Polyrhythm | High | Multiple B conflict |

### The Art of Tension

Good music manages tension through time:
```
Build tension (increase misalignment)
  → Delay resolution (hold high cost)
  → Resolve (snap to alignment)
  → Repeat at higher level
```

## Musical Forms as BLD Structure

### 12-Bar Blues

```
B: Three phrase boundaries (I-IV-I-V-I)
L: I→IV→I→V→I progression
D: 12 bars, repeating
```

### Sonata Form

```
B: Exposition / Development / Recapitulation
L: Tonic-dominant relationship across sections
D: Two themes, multiple iterations
```

### Verse-Chorus

```
B: Verse / Chorus / Bridge
L: Harmonic relationship between sections
D: Verse 1, 2, 3; Chorus repeats
```

---

## Compensation in Music

### L → B Compensation

Dense harmony (D×L) can substitute for clear structural boundaries:

```
Impressionism: Weak B (ambiguous key), rich L (extended chords)
Minimalism: Clear B (ostinato), sparse L (triads)
```

When L is rich, B can be soft. The relationships carry the music.

### B Cannot Compensate for L

Clear structure without harmonic connection feels:
- Mechanical (MIDI quantization)
- Empty (power chords only)
- Disconnected (random section order)

Rhythm (B) alone doesn't create musical meaning — you need harmonic relationships (L).

## Quick Analysis Template

For any piece of music:

1. **B**: Where are the structural boundaries?
   - Key changes, section breaks, phrase endings
   - Strong beats, cadence points

2. **L**: What connects harmonically/melodically?
   - Voice leading, chord progressions
   - Tension-resolution patterns
   - Motivic relationships

3. **D**: What repeats?
   - Verse count, chorus returns
   - Bar groupings, pulse patterns
   - Layered voices

4. **Alignment**: Does it feel right?
   - Glide = expectations met, groove achieved
   - Friction = deliberate tension or compositional problem

## Experiencing Structure in Music

When analyzing music, notice your experience:

| Experience | Structural Interpretation |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Groove | D×L aligned with listener's pulse |
| Surprise | B violated (key change, deceptive cadence) |
| Satisfaction | L resolved to expected B |
| Boredom | Too much D, not enough L variation |
| Confusion | B unclear, L too complex |
| Beauty | Perfect alignment across B/L/D |

**The friction/glide experience is real in music.** Use it diagnostically.

## Examples

### Perfect Cadence (V → I)

```
BLD Analysis:
  B: Tonic boundary established
  L: Dominant pulls to tonic (leading tone → tonic)
  D: Single instance

  Strong L alignment with B → satisfying resolution
```

### Deceptive Cadence (V → vi)

```
BLD Analysis:
  B: Expected tonic NOT reached
  L: Dominant's pull diverted
  D: Often leads to extended progression

  L → B expectation violated → tension/surprise
```

### Ostinato

```
BLD Analysis:
  B: Clear rhythmic/harmonic boundary
  L: Minimal change per repetition
  D: High (many repetitions)

  D×B dominates, L interest from subtle variation
```

## What BLD Does NOT Explain

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Why consonance? | Physics of frequency ratios |
| Why emotion? | Requires psychology |
| Why cultural preference? | Requires context |
| Why specific scales? | Historical/cultural |

BLD reveals structure but doesn't explain why certain structures move us. The emotional power of music may be structural resonance, but that's hypothesis, not proof.
