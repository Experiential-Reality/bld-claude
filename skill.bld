# skill.bld - BLD Claude Skill Structure
#
# This structure defines how Claude applies BLD analysis.
# The skill itself IS a BLD structure - meta-recursion.
#
# Optimized for Claude's attention limits:
#   - Front-loaded critical info (first 20 lines = 80% of tasks)
#   - Minimal B (few mode switches)
#   - Local L (self-contained domains)
#   - Lazy D (domains loaded on-demand)

# =============================================================================
# MANDATORY WORKFLOW - DO THIS EVERY TIME
# =============================================================================
#
# BLD is a language for articulating structure. Writing .bld forces precision.
#
# 1. WRITE in .bld         → Articulate structure formally, not in prose
# 2. RUN  bld parse        → See the structure you've articulated
# 3. RUN  bld cost         → Measure alignment cost
# 4. ITERATE               → Refine until articulation matches reality
#
# The structure is the artifact. The language reveals it.

# =============================================================================
# BLD TOOLS - the language draws itself
# =============================================================================
#
# bld parse <file.bld>    → See the structure
# bld cost <file.bld>     → Measure alignment cost
# bld doc <file.bld>      → Generate documentation
# bld run <file.bld>      → Execute/traverse structure
# bld compile <file.bld>  → Compile to binary
#
# WHY SELF-REFERENTIAL?
#
# BLD describes structure. The BLD toolchain IS structure.
# Therefore BLD describes itself. This isn't clever recursion -
# it's the only consistent choice. A language for structure that
# can't express its own structure would be incomplete.
#
# Draw everything with BLD. If you can't draw it, you don't understand it.

# =============================================================================
# FORMULAS
# =============================================================================
#
# Cost = B + D×L
# L = -½ ln(1 - ρ²)
#
# THE THREE QUESTIONS:
#   Q1: Where does behavior partition? → B
#   Q2: What connects to what? → L
#   Q3: What repeats? → D
#
# KEY PRINCIPLES:
#   - D×L scaling: D multiplies L, not B
#   - Compensation: L can compensate for B deficiency, not vice versa
#   - B is topological (invariant), L is geometric (scales)

# =============================================================================
# BOUNDARIES (B) - Where behavior partitions
# =============================================================================

# The workflow - MANDATORY steps
B workflow: write_bld | run_parse | run_cost | iterate
  write_bld -> articulate_formally, not_prose, file=<name>.bld
  run_parse -> bld_parse, see_structure, verify_articulation
  run_cost -> bld_cost, measure_alignment, check_DxL
  iterate -> refine_articulation, match_reality

# The three questions - core method
B question: q1_partition | q2_connection | q3_repetition
  q1_partition -> ask("Where does behavior partition?"), find(B)
  q2_connection -> ask("What connects to what?"), find(L)
  q3_repetition -> ask("What repeats?"), find(D)

# The three primitives - fundamental types
B primitive: boundary | link | dimension
  boundary -> topological, invariant_under_D, local_scope
  link -> geometric, scales_with_D, can_span_distance
  dimension -> multiplier_on_L, not_on_B

# BLD tool commands - the language's own toolchain
B tool: parse | cost | doc | run | compile
  parse -> see_structure, normalize, verify
  cost -> measure_alignment, B_plus_DxL
  doc -> generate_documentation, bld_all_the_way_down
  run -> execute, traverse
  compile -> binary, optimize

# Epistemic status - how validated is the claim
B epistemic: validated | derived | mechanism | exploratory | foundational
  validated -> empirical_tests_pass, quantitative_metrics
  derived -> mathematical_proof, follows_from_BLD
  mechanism -> structure_identified, values_TBD
  exploratory -> hypothesis, needs_testing
  foundational -> core_definition, axiomatic

# =============================================================================
# LINKS (L) - What connects to what
# =============================================================================

# Workflow sequence - MANDATORY, sequential
L workflow_seq: write_bld -> run_parse -> run_cost -> iterate (deps=1, sequential=true)

# Core analysis flow
L apply_questions: system -> structure (deps=1)
L extract_B: system -> boundaries (deps=0)
L extract_L: system -> links (deps=0)
L extract_D: system -> dimensions (deps=0)

# Validation chain
L validate: hypothesis -> evidence (deps=1)

# Compensation (asymmetric - L can compensate B, not vice versa)
L compensate: L -> B_deficiency (deps=1, direction=forward_only)

# Domain loading (lazy - only when needed)
L load_domain: question -> domain (uses=domains/*.bld, deps=0)

# =============================================================================
# DIMENSIONS (D) - What repeats
# =============================================================================

# Domains are loaded lazily (not all at once)
D domains: N [parallel, lazy]

# The three questions always apply
D questions: 3 [sequential]

# The three primitives are fixed
D primitives: 3 [parallel]
